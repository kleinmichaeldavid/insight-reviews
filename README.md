# BrandGuard

This is the repository for my project for Insight Data Science. The goal was to determine how well an online shop aligns with the branding of an online marketplace using customer reviews. See presentation slides for more information: https://tinyurl.com/y4tqch2f.

The repository contains the code for a flask app (in the folder flask app) that is hosted at mikeklein.ca, as well as a jupyter notebook containing an overview of the various components of the model (https://github.com/kleinmichaeldavid/insight-reviews/blob/master/Overview%20of%20Project.ipynb).
